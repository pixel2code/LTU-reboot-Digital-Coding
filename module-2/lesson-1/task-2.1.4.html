    Definition and Usage 
    =================

    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red

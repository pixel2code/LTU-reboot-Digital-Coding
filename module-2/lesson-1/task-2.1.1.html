Hello world!
  
This is example text showing how HTML and CSS work together to apply structure and presentation layer to content.

This content would probably look better if it was a bit more spaced out and if certain key words or phrases were highlighted - maybe by making them a different colour?

</body>
</html>

<!-- 
    Example Explained
    =================

    * The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
    * The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    * The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    * The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
    * The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
